PONG by Peter

Just the classic Pong game written in Lua and using the Love2d library.
My references include the on-line courses from DevJeeper and Sheepolution among others.

    The code is simple on purpose, no physics library is used.
    Game play can be controlled with either the keyboard or a game-pad.
    Game states are used to direct the flow of the game.
    I drew the backgrounds using the GIMP and make the game objects with Piskel.

This is my first attempt to give back a little for all the great open source code out there, I hope someone finds bits of it to be useful.

Thanks,
Peter
p.s.: I am just getting started so constructive comments are welcome!
